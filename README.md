This project uses data from the US Immigration office detailing immigration records into the US. It has the categories of State of Residence, Country of Birth, and Major Class of Admission (Immediate Relatives - Spouses, Employment Preference 2nd, Employment Preference 4th, Immediate Relatives - Parents, Family Preference 2nd, Employment Preference 1st, Immediate Relatives - Children, Employment Preference 3rd Skilled, Diversity Program, Other, Family Preference 3rd, Refugee and Asylee Adjustments, Family Preference 4th, Employment Preference 3rd Unskilled, Employment Preference 5th, Family Preference 1st). Using past information from who was application was accepted and whose was denied, the data was trained and tested to determain the relative pattern in immigration. From thsi trained data, a machine learning algorithm was created allowing one to write where they are choosing to immigrate to, where from, and under what category are the immigrating for. The algorithm will then determain whether they will be accepted or denied, afterhwich it will dispaly an accuracy result for that specific person.
